# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

# Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This project showcases a modern data warehousing and analytics solution, covering data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and reporting. It is designed to demonstrate industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

📖 Project Overview:

**Key Components:**
✅ Data Architecture: Implementing a Medallion Architecture(The term "Medallion" refers to the three-tiered structure) with Bronze(extract), Silver(transform), and Gold(Load) layers.
✅ ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from source systems into a structured data warehouse.
✅ Data Modeling: Designing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
✅ Analytics & Reporting: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

🏗️ ## Data Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture:

1️⃣ Bronze Layer → Stores raw data as-is from source systems (CSV files ingested into SQL Server).
2️⃣ Silver Layer → Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data for consistency.
3️⃣ Gold Layer → Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.



🔧 Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data for analytical reporting and decision-making.

Specifications

Data Sources: ERP and CRM data (CSV files).
Data Quality: Cleansing, standardization, and issue resolution.
Integration: Merging data from multiple sources into a structured analytical model.
Scope: Focus on latest datasets only (no historization).
Documentation: Providing a well-documented data model for business and analytics teams.
SQL-Based Analytics (Data Analysis)
Developing SQL-based queries to generate insights into:
📊 Customer Behavior
📊 Product Performance
📊 Sales Trends

These insights enable stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions.
